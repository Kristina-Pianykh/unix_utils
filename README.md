# UNIX Utils

A playground to reimplement some UNIX utilities in a simplified way to get familiaried with the UNIX way of doing things.

A great deal of inspiration came from the book [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau written with wit and humour.
